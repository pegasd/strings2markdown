# Strings2markdown

This gem is intended to generate the `Reference` part of puppet module's README.md.

## Installation

Add this line to your puppet module's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'strings2markdown'
```

and update your installation

```shell
bundle
```

## Usage

TODO:

- Write rake task.

## Development
